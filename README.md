# [Material Dashboard React]

![Product Gif](src/assets/github/md-react.gif)

Material Dashboard React makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple different layers, so that the depth and order is obvious. The navigation stays mainly on the left sidebar and the content is on the right inside the main panel.

Material Dashboard React comes with 5 color filter choices for both the sidebar and the card headers (blue, green, orange, red and purple) and an option to have a background image on the sidebar.

Material Dashboard React was created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and it uses a framework built by our friend [Olivier - Material-UI v3.1.0](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), who did an amazing job creating the backbone for the material effects, animations, ripples and transitions. Big thanks to his team for the effort and forward thinking they put into it.
